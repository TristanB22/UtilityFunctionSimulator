To estimate the probability that Alice receives a job offer from Google as a software engineer within the next 6 months, let's break down the process into several steps:

1. **Application**: Alice applies to Google for a software engineer position.
2. **Resume Screening**: Her resume passes the initial screening by Google's recruiters.
3. **Online Assessment**: She passes Google's online assessment.
4. **Interview Invitation**: She gets invited for an interview.
5. **Interview Performance**: She performs well in the interviews.
6. **Job Offer**: She receives a job offer.

Assumptions:
- Each step is almost entirely independent of the others.
- Alice's qualifications: 3.8 GPA from a state university and two internships at local companies.

Based on general statistics and assuming Alice's preparation and performance are good:
- **Application**: Assuming she applies to multiple companies including Google, the probability that she applies to Google can be considered high, e.g., 0.8 (she targets top companies).
- **Resume Screening**: For a recent CS graduate with a 3.8 GPA and relevant internships, let's assume a moderate to high chance of passing, e.g., 0.6.
- **Online Assessment**: The pass rate varies but assuming she is well-prepared, let's give it 0.3.
- **Interview Invitation**: If she passes the online assessment, let's assume a high chance of getting an invite, e.g., 0.7.
- **Interview Performance**: Given her background and preparation, let's assume a good performance probability of 0.5.
- **Job Offer**: If she performs well, the probability of getting a job offer can be considered high, e.g., 0.6.
