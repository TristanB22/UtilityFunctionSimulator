# Labor

This directory contains components for simulating labor market dynamics in the World_Sim project.

## Components

### Labor Market
- Job matching
- Wage determination
- Employment dynamics
- Skill requirements
- Market clearing

### Worker Characteristics
- Skills and education
- Experience levels
- Wage expectations
- Geographic preferences
- Industry preferences

### Job Characteristics

- Compensation structure
- Working conditions
- Location requirements
- Industry classification

## Features

### Market Dynamics

## Usage

```python
from Labor import Labor

# Create a labor market
labor_market = Labor(
    location="Bar Harbor, ME",
    industry="retail"
)

# Add jobs
labor_market.add_job(
    title="Sales Associate",
    required_skills=["customer_service", "sales"],
    wage_range=(15, 20)
)

# Add workers
labor_market.add_worker(
    skills=["customer_service", "sales"],
    experience=2,
    wage_expectation=18
)

# Run market simulation
results = labor_market.simulate()
```
