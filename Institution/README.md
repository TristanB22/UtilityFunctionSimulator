This directory contains components for modeling institutional frameworks in the World_Sim project.

## Components

### Government Institutions
- Policy making
- Regulation
- Public services
- Resource allocation
- Decision making

### Financial Institutions
- Banking systems
- Credit markets
- Investment vehicles
- Risk management
- Financial regulation

### Educational Institutions
- Schools and universities
- Training programs
- Skill development
- Research and development
- Knowledge transfer

### Healthcare Institutions
- Hospitals and clinics
- Insurance systems
- Public health
- Medical research
- Healthcare delivery

## Features

### Policy Implementation
- Rule enforcement
- Resource distribution
- Service delivery
- Monitoring and evaluation
- Feedback mechanisms

### Institutional Behavior
- Decision making
- Resource management
- Service provision
- Stakeholder interaction
- Performance metrics

### Market Interaction
- Regulation
- Market making
- Price setting
- Quality control
- Competition policy

## Usage

```python
from Institution import Institution

# Create an institution
institution = Institution(
    type="government",
    jurisdiction="Bar Harbor, ME",
    responsibilities=["regulation", "public_services"]
)

# Implement policy
institution.implement_policy(
    policy_type="economic",
    parameters={
        "tax_rate": 0.05,
        "spending_priorities": ["education", "healthcare"]
    }
)

# Monitor performance
performance = institution.evaluate_performance()
```

## Configuration

Institution behavior can be configured through:
- Policy parameters
- Resource allocation
- Service levels
- Performance targets
- Regulatory framework

## Contributing

When adding new institutions:
1. Follow existing code structure
2. Implement required methods
3. Add appropriate tests
4. Update documentation
5. Consider institutional dynamics
6. Validate assumptions

## Best Practices

1. Use appropriate models
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Add comprehensive logging
4. Include type hints
5. Document all methods
6. Add unit tests
7. Consider institutional dynamics
8. Validate results

## Testing

- Unit tests for institution behavior
- Integration tests for interactions
- Policy implementation tests
- Performance evaluation tests
- Scenario testing
